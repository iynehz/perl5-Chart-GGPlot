Revision history for Chart::GGPlot

0.0004_01   TBD
  - New feature: geom_polygon()

0.0003      2019-05-04
  - New feature: basic support of geom_boxplot()
  - New feature: coord_flip()
  - coord_cartesian() now really supports :$xlim, :$ylim arguments.
  - Add a Chart::GGPlot::Plot::iplot() method for convenience of plotting 
    in Jupyter Notebook.
  - Chart::GGPlot::Util::dollar() behavior is now more consistant. Hope
    this can fix a unit test failure in some special environments.
    (github #6)
  - Performance improvements: Together with improments in
    Alt::Data::Frame::ButMore, now for an extreme case of "diamonds" scatter    example, which is quite slow among the examples, it's become 3x faster
    compared to before to run in exporting-to-png mode.
  - Some doc improvements.
